## Core Workflows

### 1. Project Discovery & Setup

**The Problem**: You're starting work on a new Nim project and want your AI assistant to understand the entire codebase.

**The Solution**: Use NimGenie's indexing tools to analyze everything.

#### Example AI Conversation:

**You**: "I want to work on this Nim project. Help me understand what it does and how it's structured."

**AI Assistant**: I'll help you analyze this Nim project! Let me start by indexing the project and its dependencies to understand the codebase structure.

*AI uses: `indexCurrentProject()`*

**AI Assistant**: Great! I've indexed your project. Let me get some statistics about what we're working with.

*AI uses: `getProjectStats()`*

**AI Assistant**: Based on the analysis, this project has:
- X source files with Y symbols total
- Z dependencies including packages like [list]
- Main modules: [module names]
- Project type: [library/executable/hybrid]

Let me also check the project status to understand the current setup.

*AI uses: `nimbleProjectStatus()`*

**AI Assistant**: Now I have a complete understanding of your project! Here's what I found:
[Detailed explanation of project structure, dependencies, and capabilities]

Would you like me to explore any specific part of the codebase or help with a particular task?

### 2. Code Exploration & API Discovery

**The Problem**: You need to find specific functionality or understand how certain features work.

#### Example AI Conversation:

**You**: "I need to add HTTP client functionality to my project. Show me what's available and help me choose the right approach."

**AI Assistant**: I'll help you explore HTTP client options! Let me search for existing HTTP-related functionality and available packages.

*AI uses: `searchSymbols("http", "", "")`*

**AI Assistant**: I found some HTTP-related symbols in your current codebase. Now let me search for available HTTP client packages in the Nimble registry.

*AI uses: `nimbleSearchPackages("http client")`*

**AI Assistant**: Here are the best HTTP client options for Nim:

1. **httpx** - Modern async HTTP client
2. **curly** - Simple synchronous HTTP client  
3. **httpclient** - Standard library HTTP client

Based on your project structure, I recommend `curly` for simplicity. Let me install it and show you how to use it.

*AI uses: `nimbleInstallPackage("curly", "")`*

**AI Assistant**: Perfect! I've installed curly. Now let me index it so we can explore its API.

*AI uses: `indexNimblePackage("curly")`*

*AI uses: `searchSymbols("get", "proc", "curly")`*

**AI Assistant**: Here's how to use curly for HTTP requests:

```nim
import curly

# Simple GET request
let response = curly.get("https://api.example.com/data")
echo response.body

# POST with JSON data
let postResponse = curly.post("https://api.example.com/submit", 
                              headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
                              body = """{"key": "value"}""")
```

Would you like me to help you integrate this into your specific use case?

### 3. Development & Debugging

**The Problem**: You're implementing a feature and need help with syntax, debugging, or testing.

#### Example AI Conversation:

**You**: "I'm getting compilation errors in my project. Help me fix them and add proper error handling."

**AI Assistant**: I'll help you debug the compilation issues! Let me check the syntax of your project first.

*AI uses: `checkSyntax()`*

**AI Assistant**: I found several compilation errors:

1. Line 45: `undefined identifier 'processData'`
2. Line 67: `type mismatch: expected string, got int`  
3. Line 89: `missing import for json module`

Let me search your codebase to understand the context and find the right solutions.

*AI uses: `searchSymbols("processData", "", "")`*

**AI Assistant**: I see the issue! The `processData` function is defined in the `utils` module but not imported. Here's how to fix these errors:

```nim
# Add these imports at the top of your file
import json, strutils
import utils  # This contains processData

# Fix the type mismatch on line 67
let result = processData($inputNumber)  # Convert int to string

# Add proper error handling
try:
  let data = parseJson(jsonString)
  let result = processData(data["field"].getStr())
except JsonParsingError:
  echo "Error: Invalid JSON format"
except KeyError:
  echo "Error: Missing required field"
```

Now let me check if the syntax is correct:

*AI uses: `checkSyntax()`*

**AI Assistant**: Excellent! All syntax errors are resolved. Would you like me to help you add unit tests for this functionality?

### 4. Package & Dependency Management

**The Problem**: You need to manage project dependencies, explore packages, or set up a new project.

#### Example AI Conversation:

**You**: "I want to create a new web API project with proper testing. Set it up with the best practices and packages."

**AI Assistant**: I'll help you create a professional web API project! Let me set up a new project with the right structure and dependencies.

*AI uses: `nimbleInitProject("my-web-api", "bin")`*

**AI Assistant**: Great! I've created your new web API project. Now let me search for the best packages for web development and testing.

*AI uses: `nimbleSearchPackages("web framework")`*
*AI uses: `nimbleSearchPackages("testing")`*

**AI Assistant**: I recommend these packages for your web API:

1. **jester** - Lightweight web framework
2. **unittest2** - Advanced testing framework  
3. **json** - JSON handling (standard library)

Let me install them:

*AI uses: `nimbleInstallPackage("jester", "")`*
*AI uses: `nimbleInstallPackage("unittest2", "")`*

**AI Assistant**: Now let me index these packages so we can explore their APIs:

*AI uses: `indexNimblePackage("jester")`*
*AI uses: `indexNimblePackage("unittest2")`*

*AI uses: `searchSymbols("get", "template", "jester")`*
*AI uses: `searchSymbols("test", "template", "unittest2")`*

**AI Assistant**: Perfect! Here's your project structure with example code:

```nim
# src/my_web_api.nim
import jester, json

routes:
  get "/api/health":
    resp Http200, %*{"status": "healthy", "timestamp": now()}
  
  get "/api/users/@id":
    let userId = @"id"
    # Your user logic here
    resp Http200, %*{"user": userId}

when isMainModule:
  let port = Port(8080)
  echo "Starting web API on port ", port
  serve(port)
```

```nim
# tests/test_api.nim
import unittest2, json, httpclient
import ../src/my_web_api

suite "Web API Tests":
  test "health endpoint returns 200":
    let client = newHttpClient()
    let response = client.get("http://localhost:8080/api/health")
    check response.status == Http200
    
    let data = parseJson(response.body)
    check data["status"].getStr() == "healthy"
```

Let me build and test the project:

*AI uses: `nimbleBuildProject()`*
*AI uses: `nimbleTestProject()`*

**AI Assistant**: Your web API project is ready! The build succeeded and all tests pass. You can run it with:

```bash
nimble run
```

Would you like me to help you add more endpoints or implement specific features?

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Contributing to an Open Source Project

**Scenario**: You want to contribute to an existing Nim project on GitHub.

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/nim-lang/someproject
cd someproject

# Start NimGenie
nimgenie
```

**AI Conversation**:

**You**: "I want to contribute to this project by adding a new feature. Help me understand the codebase and find where to make changes."

**AI Assistant**: I'll help you explore this project and understand how to contribute effectively!

*AI uses: `indexCurrentProject()`*
*AI uses: `getProjectStats()`*
*AI uses: `nimbleShowDependencies(true)`*

**AI Assistant**: This is a [project analysis]. The codebase has [statistics]. 

Let me search for similar functionality to understand the patterns:

*AI uses: `searchSymbols("similar_feature", "", "")`*

**AI Assistant**: Based on the codebase patterns, here's where you should implement your new feature:

1. **Core logic**: Add to `src/core/[module].nim`
2. **Tests**: Create `tests/test_new_feature.nim`
3. **Documentation**: Update `docs/[relevant].md`

Here's a template following the project's conventions:

```nim
# Following the project's style and patterns
proc newFeature*(input: InputType): ResultType =
  ## Add your new feature here
  # Implementation following project patterns
```

Would you like me to help you implement the specific feature you have in mind?

### Example 2: Performance Optimization

**Scenario**: Your Nim application is slow and you need to optimize it.

**You**: "My application is running slowly. Help me identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the code."

**AI Assistant**: I'll help you identify and fix performance issues! Let me analyze your codebase for potential bottlenecks.

*AI uses: `searchSymbols("", "proc", "")`*
*AI uses: `getProjectStats()`*

**AI Assistant**: I found several areas to investigate for performance:

1. **Hot paths**: Functions called frequently
2. **Memory allocation**: String operations, sequences
3. **I/O operations**: File and network access

Let me search for specific patterns that often cause performance issues:

*AI uses: `searchSymbols("string", "proc", "")`*
*AI uses: `searchSymbols("seq", "type", "")`*

**AI Assistant**: Here are the optimization opportunities I found:

```nim
# Before: Inefficient string concatenation
proc buildMessage(items: seq[string]): string =
  for item in items:
    result = result & item & "\n"  # Inefficient!

# After: Efficient string building
proc buildMessage(items: seq[string]): string =
  var parts = newSeqOfCap[string](items.len)
  for item in items:
    parts.add(item)
  return parts.join("\n")
```

Let me also check for packages that could help with performance:

*AI uses: `nimbleSearchPackages("performance optimization")`*

**AI Assistant**: I recommend profiling your application with these tools and techniques:

1. Use `--profiler:on` compiler flag
2. Add timing measurements to hot paths
3. Consider the `stint` library for high-performance integers

Would you like me to help you implement specific optimizations?

### Example 3: Testing Strategy

**Scenario**: You need to improve test coverage and testing practices.

**You**: "I want to add comprehensive testing to my project. Show me what's already tested and help me add more test coverage."

**AI Assistant**: I'll help you analyze and improve your testing strategy!

*AI uses: `searchSymbols("test", "", "")`*
*AI uses: `searchSymbols("", "proc", "")`*

**AI Assistant**: I found your current test coverage:

**Tested modules**: [list of tested areas]
**Untested functions**: [list of functions without tests]

Let me search for testing-related packages:

*AI uses: `nimbleSearchPackages("testing")`*
*AI uses: `nimbleListPackages(true)`*

**AI Assistant**: Here's a comprehensive testing strategy for your project:

```nim
# tests/test_comprehensive.nim
import unittest2, times
import ../src/your_module

suite "Comprehensive Module Tests":
  setup:
    # Setup code run before each test
    discard
  
  teardown:
    # Cleanup code run after each test
    discard

  test "function handles normal input":
    let result = yourFunction("normal input")
    check result == "expected output"
  
  test "function handles edge cases":
    expect(ValueError):
      discard yourFunction("invalid input")
  
  test "performance requirements":
    let startTime = cpuTime()
    let result = yourFunction("performance test")
    let duration = cpuTime() - startTime
    check duration < 0.1  # Must complete in < 100ms
```

Let me run your existing tests to see the current status:

*AI uses: `nimbleTestProject()`*

**AI Assistant**: Your test results: [results]. Here are the areas that need more test coverage:

1. **Error handling paths**
2. **Edge cases and boundary conditions**
3. **Performance requirements**
4. **Integration tests**

Would you like me to help you write tests for any specific functionality?

```

## Advanced Use Cases

### 1. Multi-Project Development

When working on multiple related Nim projects (e.g., a web service and its client library):

```bash
# Terminal 1: Main service
cd /path/to/web-service
nimgenie --port 8080

# Terminal 2: Client library  
cd /path/to/client-lib
nimgenie --port 8081
```

**AI Assistant Usage:**
```
AI can now understand both projects simultaneously and help you:
- Keep APIs in sync between service and client
- Share common types and structures
- Manage dependencies between projects
- Coordinate testing across both codebases
```

### 2. Large Codebase Navigation

For large projects with hundreds of modules:

**You**: "This codebase is huge. Help me understand the architecture and find where authentication is handled."

*AI uses multiple tools to map the architecture:*
- `getProjectStats()` - Understand scale
- `searchSymbols("auth", "", "")` - Find auth-related code
- `searchSymbols("login", "", "")` - Find login functionality
- `searchSymbols("token", "", "")` - Find token handling

### 3. Legacy Code Modernization

**You**: "This Nim project is using old patterns. Help me modernize it to current best practices."

*AI analyzes patterns and suggests improvements:*
- Identifies deprecated language features
- Suggests modern library alternatives
- Helps refactor to current idioms
- Updates dependency management

### 4. Performance Analysis at Scale

**You**: "Profile this entire application and find all performance bottlenecks."

*AI systematically analyzes:*
- All function signatures for complexity indicators
- Memory allocation patterns
- I/O operation locations
- Dependency analysis for heavy libraries

## Tips & Best Practices

### üöÄ Getting Started Right

1. **Always index first**: Run `indexCurrentProject()` when starting work on any Nim project
2. **Update dependencies**: Use `indexProjectDependenciesOnly()` when dependencies change
3. **Check project status**: Use `nimbleProjectStatus()` to understand project health

### üîç Effective Code Search

1. **Start broad, then narrow**: 
   - Search `searchSymbols("http", "", "")` first
   - Then `searchSymbols("http", "proc", "mymodule")` for specifics

2. **Use symbol types effectively**:
   - `"proc"` for functions and methods
   - `"type"` for custom types and objects
   - `"const"` for constants
   - `"var"` for variables
   - `"template"` for templates
   - `"macro"` for macros

3. **Explore packages before using**:
   ```
   nimbleSearchPackages("web framework")
   nimblePackageInfo("jester")
   nimblePackageVersions("jester")
   ```

### üì¶ Package Management

1. **Research before installing**:
   ```
   nimbleSearchPackages("http client")
   nimblePackageInfo("curly")
   nimblePackageVersions("curly")
   nimbleInstallPackage("curly", ">= 1.0.0")
   ```

2. **Keep dependencies clean**:
   ```
   nimbleShowDependencies(true)  # See dependency tree
   nimbleUpgradePackages()       # Keep packages updated
   ```

3. **Index new packages immediately**:
   ```
   nimbleInstallPackage("newpackage")
   indexNimblePackage("newpackage")  # Make it searchable
   ```

### üèóÔ∏è Development Workflow

1. **Continuous validation**:
   - Use `checkSyntax()` frequently during development
   - Run `nimbleTestProject()` before commits
   - Use `nimbleBuildProject()` to verify compilation

2. **Resource management**:
   - Use `addDirectoryResource()` for docs, assets, examples
   - `listDirectoryResources()` to see what's available
   - Organize project files for AI assistant access

### üß™ Testing Strategy

1. **Comprehensive testing**:
   ```
   nimbleTestProject()                    # Run all tests
   nimbleTestProject("test_specific")     # Run specific tests
   nimbleBuildProject("", "debug")        # Debug builds for testing
   ```

2. **Performance testing**:
   - Use timing in tests
   - Profile with `--profiler:on`
   - Monitor memory usage patterns

### ‚ö° Performance Optimization

1. **AI-assisted optimization**:
   - Let AI search for performance patterns
   - Ask for specific optimization suggestions
   - Use AI to find alternative algorithms

2. **Systematic approach**:
   ```
   # Search for potential bottlenecks
   searchSymbols("string", "proc", "")  # String operations
   searchSymbols("seq", "type", "")     # Sequence usage
   searchSymbols("array", "type", "")   # Array usage
   ```

### üîß Development Environment

1. **Consistent setup**:
   - Always run NimGenie from project root
   - Use `--verbose` for debugging setup issues
   - Keep TiDB running for best performance

2. **Multiple projects**:
   - Use different ports for different projects
   - Share database for symbol search across projects
   - Use project-specific configurations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. NimGenie Won't Start

**Problem**: `Error: Database connection failed`

**Solution**:
```bash
# Start TiDB first
tiup playground

# Then start NimGenie
nimgenie --verbose
```

#### 2. Indexing Fails

**Problem**: `Failed to index project: permission denied`

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check file permissions
ls -la src/

# Run from project root
cd /your/project/root
nimgenie
```

#### 3. Symbols Not Found

**Problem**: AI can't find symbols you know exist

**Solution**:
1. Re-index the project:
   ```
   indexCurrentProject()
   ```

2. Check if dependencies are indexed:
   ```
   listNimblePackages()
   indexNimblePackage("package_name")
   ```

3. Verify symbol search:
   ```
   searchSymbols("symbol_name", "", "")
   ```

#### 4. Package Installation Issues

**Problem**: `nimbleInstallPackage` fails

**Solution**:
1. Update package list:
   ```
   nimbleRefreshPackages()
   ```

2. Check package exists:
   ```
   nimbleSearchPackages("package_name")
   ```

3. Try specific version:
   ```
   nimbleInstallPackage("package", ">= 1.0.0")
   ```

#### 5. Performance Issues

**Problem**: NimGenie responses are slow

**Solutions**:
1. **Database optimization**:
   - Ensure TiDB is running locally
   - Check database connection pooling
   - Monitor database size

2. **Cache optimization**:
   - Restart NimGenie to clear cache
   - Use specific searches instead of broad ones

3. **Project size**:
   - Index only necessary dependencies
   - Use `indexProjectDependenciesOnly()` for updates

### Getting Help

1. **Verbose logging**:
   ```bash
   nimgenie --verbose --port 8080
   ```

2. **Check project status**:
   ```
   nimbleProjectStatus()
   getProjectStats()
   ```

3. **Database diagnostics**:
   ```
   listDirectoryResources()
   listNimblePackages()
   ```

4. **AI Assistant diagnostics**:
   - Ask AI to run multiple diagnostic commands
   - Compare results with expected behavior
   - Use AI to interpret error messages
